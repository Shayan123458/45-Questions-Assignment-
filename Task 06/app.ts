// 6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
//  and end of the name. Make sure you use each
// character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around 
// the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces
